Although my gifs more directly relate to Facebook currently than when it was founded (like in /The Social Network/), I still feel like they are relevant to my thoughts on Facebook generally as a whole (even if the Epic Rap Battles of History video came out before I saw the movie.)

On a side note, I'm absolutely awful at making gifs, so I apologize in advance.
