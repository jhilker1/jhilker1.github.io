Recently, I finished my first playthrough of /Super Metroid/, one of the most iconic games from the SNES (though my run was not very good, with 12 hours 21 minutes in game time and only 72% of the items collected).  Looking ahead on the syllabus, I saw that we would have to play the game [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][Limbo]] and analyze it for one of our assignments. I wanted to go ahead and explain my thoughts for why I feel Super Metroid is such a good game. 

* 1. World Design 
Mark Brown talked about the world design of the game extensively on his Youtube miniseries Boss Keys[fn:1], and I share many of his thoughts.

Personally, I found that the interconnected world was my favorite part of the game. Although I haven't finished /Dark Souls/ yet, I loved how interconnected the world was and how everything just sort of fit together. 

* 2. Sound Design and Music


[fn:1] Although this specific series is on world and level design, his channel is an excellent resource for anyone interested in game development.
