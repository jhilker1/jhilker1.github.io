Recently, I finished my first playthrough of /Super Metroid/, one of the most iconic games from the SNES (though my run was not very good, with 12 hours 21 minutes in game time and only 72% of the items collected).  Looking ahead on the syllabus, I saw that we would have to play the game [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][Limbo]] and analyze it for one of our assignments. I wanted to go ahead and explain my thoughts for why I feel super metroid is such a good game.
