* HELLO WORLD
  Hello there, and welcome to my website. This currently houses my resume, as well as some of the projects I’ve been working on. I’m working on a blog currently, but that will be up sometime in the future. This site was written in Emacs’ Org-Mode, using Hugo as an SSG. This site is using a slightly modified version of the [[https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole][Anatole]] theme for Hugo, as well as the wrapper from Luis Fuentes' resume project on Gitlab.

* ABOUT ME
  I'm currently a senior at the University of Mary Washington, majoring in computer science and minoring in cybersecurity.

  I’ve been a drummer since about 6th grade, and I’ve been teaching myself guitar on and off since sophomore year of high school. As far as my hobbies outside of code and music, I enjoy worldbuilding and games (both video games and tabletop games, especially tabletop role-playing games.) Feel free to explore around.
