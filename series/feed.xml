Normally I can just ignore these, but there is one issue I have with regards to data - paying to keep your content private. With what seems like the sheer number of data leaks that happen each year, I strongly believe that the end user needs to be in control of their data, and that privacy should not simply be for those who can afford it. And because a wiki (to me at least) is a bunch of interconnected backlinks with information (like a Zettelkasten), it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult to implement in Hugo with Org-roam (or with something like Obsidian, though I would much rather use org-roam because I&amp;rsquo;m already in Emacs.) By the end of this series, you should hopefully be able to have a basic configured wiki with search and with infoboxes (like from Wikipedia), and you should hopefully be able to capture ideas quickly and add them to the wiki.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This series assumes you already have a basic hugo website set-up with a theme installed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
